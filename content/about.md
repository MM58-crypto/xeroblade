## Greetings All

My name is MM and iam a Software Engineer graduate.

This website currently lacks a defined purpose. It can be viewed as a blog where I primarily focus on computer science but can also delve into other areas. Additionally, I intend to provide posts addressing persistent errors or issues encountered in programming or OS-related matters
