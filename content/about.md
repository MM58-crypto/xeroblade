  ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ | Greetings | あいさつ | Grüße

My name is MM and iam a Junior Software Engineer.

This website currently lacks a defined purpose. It can be viewed as a blog where I primarily focus on computer science but can also delve into other areas. Additionally, I intend to provide posts addressing persistent errors or issues encountered in programming or OS-related matters

### BTW I use arch!
