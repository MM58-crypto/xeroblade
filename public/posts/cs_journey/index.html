        <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>As i have mentioned in my about page, iam a (technically) software engineer graduate.  I am genuinely grateful for the opportunity to attend college, as it has provided me with valuable lessons from both a technical and general life perspective. However, over the years, I have developed the opinion that formal education is not an absolute necessity for individuals aspiring to become software engineers. Unlike fields such as medicine or engineering, our work does not rely heavily on specialized equipment or lab facilities; a laptop alone is sufficient. Furthermore, the internet offers a wealth of valuable resources to learn and master the various aspects of software engineering. It is worth noting that there is a significant number of self-taught software engineers who have made remarkable contributions and developed impactful projects.</p>
<h2 id="college-vs-self-schooling">College VS &ldquo;Self-schooling&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Now i know that going through college develops discipline or a sense of responsibilty since there are consequences for not turning in assignments on time or not doing well in exams for instance.  I myself am a very lazy person and lack discipline so college did benefit me. In addition,  college can give you research related skills since you will be writing/doing  <em>a lot</em> of assignments. College also can help you in making long lasting friendship / improve your social skills. Not everyone would be psyched for &ldquo;self-schooling&rdquo;.
But the thing is, most people spend a large sum of money in order to study and get a degree and for a field that you can master on your own at home it may not be neccessary. I would also mention that in my 3 years of studying in college, most lecturers just give you the basics of the subject and you have to do the rest of the digging yourself. Basics that you can easily obtain by surfing the web and just have to pay for the internet and a computer (which i think is available to almost everyone in urban areas)</p>
<p>I think maybe in the olden times when computers weren&rsquo;t available to everyone and they were extremely expensive as well as  only used in government facilities, going to college would be an obvious choice. Nowadays,however, much cheaper (almost free) alternatives are available for learning computer science or software engineering.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The choice ultimately depends on a person&rsquo;s preference or financial abilities. My point is that this is a field that can be pursued regardless of ones financial limitations unlike many others such as Law or Medicine. I also am not including those got in college with a full scholarship in my long  rant.</p>
<p>Adios.</p>
