<p>My name is MM and iam a Software Engineer (almost) graduate. My interest in computer science began during high school (or middle school can&rsquo;t remember clearly) and i decided to pursue this field once i am done with high school. Other than the fact that i was born in a generation where we are surrounded by computers at almost all times, i had close friends who where deeply interested in this field. You can say talking to them somewhat &ldquo;sparked&rdquo; curiosity within me and led me to get interested in computers/computer science. The funny thing is even though they had far greater knowledge and potential than me when it comes to computer science and programming, they did not pursue it as a degree but enrolled in other STEM courses.</p>
<p>I have experience with several programming languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, PHP, Visual Basic, and assembly language, among others. There are probably more, but those are the ones I can recall off the top of my head. I don&rsquo;t currently have a favorite programming language, but I would say that Python is the least troublesome or easiest to deal with. There are a few reasons for this. First, Python&rsquo;s syntax is much easier to understand and learn compared to many other programming languages. Second, the error messages in Python are clear (with JavaScript being a close second). On the contrary, assembly language has the hardest syntax by far and isn&rsquo;t very easy to understand. Creating a simple calculator using Python is much easier compared to using assembly language. (I only used assembly language during my computer architecture class in university but never pursued it further after completing the subject.)</p>
<p>Although this may seem obvious, I believe that programming languages are similar to actual world languages in the sense that one must spend a significant amount of time learning the syntax and developing various projects in a specific language to master it. This is something I am yet to achieve since I have a bad habit of jumping from one project to another without finishing the initial project. This includes learning and practicing a programming language or completing a mid-scale or large development project.</p>
<p>Moving forward, this website currently lacks a defined purpose. It can be viewed as an online journal or blog where I share my thoughts on various topics, primarily focusing on computer science but also delving into other areas. Additionally, I intend to provide posts addressing persistent errors or issues encountered in programming or OS-related matters</p>
