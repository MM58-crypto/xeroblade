      <description>The beginning I have been using GNU/Linux for three years now and i wanted to share my thoughts after all this time. Like millions of others on this planet of ours, i was using windows as my primary Operating System. Every computer i have ever used had windows running on it, regardless if it was windows Xp, vista, 7, 10 or 11. As you can clearly tell, windows had complete dominance over the market.</description>

      <description>Intro As i have mentioned in my about page, iam a (technically) software engineer graduate. I am genuinely grateful for the opportunity to attend college, as it has provided me with valuable lessons from both a technical and general life perspective. However, over the years, I have developed the opinion that formal education is not an absolute necessity for individuals aspiring to become software engineers. Unlike fields such as medicine or engineering, our work does not rely heavily on specialized equipment or lab facilities; a laptop alone is sufficient.</description>

      <description>Greetings All My name is MM and iam a Software Engineer graduate.&#xA;This website currently lacks a defined purpose. It can be viewed as a blog where I share my thoughts on various topics, primarily focusing on computer science but also delving into other areas. Additionally, I intend to provide posts addressing persistent errors or issues encountered in programming or OS-related matters&#xA;Unrelated Image of the day: </description>
