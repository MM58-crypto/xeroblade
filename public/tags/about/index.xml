      <description>Greetings! My name is MM and iam a Software Engineer (almost) graduate. My interest in computer science began during high school (or middle school can&amp;rsquo;t remember clearly) and i decided to pursue this field once i am done with high school. Other than the fact that i was born in a generation where we are surrounded by computers at almost all times, i had close friends who where deeply interested in this field.</description>
